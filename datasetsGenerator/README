## Description
This program generates a *valid* Feature Model (FM) that is different from the original one with the given percentage of features and constraints.

The program adds and removes the features and constraints and ensures that the resulting FM has at least one satisfactoy selection.

## USAGE 

* arg 1: *percentage of features* that will be added/removed (e.g., if the FM has 5000 features, then 10% of modification means that a total of 500 features will either be added or removed).

* arg 2: *percentage of constraints* that will be added/removed (e.g., if the FM has 100000 constraints, then 10% modification means that a total of 10000 constraints will either be added or remove).

* arg 3: *number of new feature models* you want to be created.

* Important : argument 3 does not take into account the number of modified constraints (e.g., if you remove a constraint, you might remove some feature entirely).
 
## NOTE
* original FM, mandatory features, dead features, augment and results should be in the directory "../Feature_Model_Generator/ressources/original".
 
* The name of the FM is in FM_Name var in the main class.
