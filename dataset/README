## Description
This folder contains the 5 FM datasets that are part of the proposed benchmark: Linux Kernel, FreeBSD, eCos, Fiasco and uClinux

Each of the datasets contains both the original FM and the evolving ones.

Different distance targets are generated for each of the datasets in the form of (X.Y) where X is the percentage of modified features and Y is the percentage of modified constraints: 1.1, 5.1, 5.3, 10.1, 10.3, 10.5, 20.1, 20.3, 20.5 and 20.10

We generated 10 different targets for each distance target of a given dataset.

Each FM (i.e., either original or evolved) corresponds to a set of 5 files (i.e., dimacs, augment, dead, mandatory and richseed)
