# A benchmark for feature selection when feature models evolve


## Synopsis

We describe in this project the first benchmark of large scale *evolving* FMs, consisting of 5 popular Feature Models (FMs) i.e., Linux Kernel, FreeBSD, eCos, Fiasco and uClinux and their evolutions – synthetically generated following an experimental study of FM evolution.

## Keywords

Benchmark, Software Product Lines, Feature Selection, Evolution

## Motivation

When software architects or engineers are given a list of all the features and their interactions (i.e., a Feature Model or FM) together with stakeholders’ preferences – their task is to find a set of potential products to suggest the decision makers. 

Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) consists in optimising those large and highly constrained search spaces according to multiple objectives reflecting the preference of the different stakeholders. SPLE is known to be extremely skill- and labour-intensive and it has been a popular topic of research in the past years.

While *change* and *evolution* of software systems is the common case in the industry, to the best of our knowledge this element has been overlooked in the literature. This project presents the first thorough benchmark related to the problem of evolving software product lines.
